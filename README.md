# Libraries and Technology
We used the react library (routing, bootstrap, etc), Node.js, and uuid to generate random IDs. We used Firebase Realtime DB as our Database.

# Framework 

We used the following react framework that have vitest built in for unit testing. This was developed by Professor Christopher Riesbeck at Northwestern University for students to learn and develop apps in react (used for CS392 and CS394 at Northwestern)
